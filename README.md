# Lost Worlds

A distributed client/server semi-realtime strategy game!

Well, right now it just simulates some silly game boards. But eventually it will be mighty! Or just a fun side project when I don't want to do homework.

This version of the code is what's left of our 'original plan', of doing some vaguely settlers of catan simultaneous turn madness. It didn't end too well, but might be fun to look at.
